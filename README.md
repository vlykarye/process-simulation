# process-simulation

The code in this repository is a combined effort between myself and Larry Carranco @ https://github.com/lcarranco.
His original code may be found here: https://github.com/lcarranco/assign1v3
The code under "via-tables" is mostly mine and was scrapped before completing the project.
The code under "via-objects" is a rewrite of the code found in Larry's repository.
We worked on it together, but his code was mainly used for commits.
The goal of this repository is to simply rewrite the code as I envisioned it.
