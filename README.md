# process-simulation

The code in this repository is a combined effort between myself and Larry Carranco @ https://github.com/lcarranco.<br>
His original code may be found here: https://github.com/lcarranco/assign1v3<br>
The code under "via-tables" is mostly mine and was scrapped before completing the project.<br>
The code under "via-objects" is a rewrite of the code found in Larry's repository.<br>
We worked on it together, but his code was mainly used for commits.<br>
The goal of this repository is to simply rewrite the code as I envisioned it.<br>
